# Hourly cycle prompt

**The durable scheduler EXISTS — self-bind since 2026-09-08.** MCP Routine
`trig_017vdX5dSSYh5v68Cwe6EUBu` ("wampo hourly cycle (self-bind)", cron
`7 * * * *`) wakes the MAIN WEB SESSION every hour. Its predecessor
(`trig_01XBJTunkpj2T8bLKHzdsKsA`, created 2026-09-06, fresh-session mode)
fired ~40 times and committed NOTHING — see the diagnosis below. The Routine
mechanism itself survives
container restarts, which the in-memory `CronCreate` job never did — that job
died **nine times**, and the price of relying on it was two days (2026-09-05/06)
in which the pipeline ran but no agent work happened at all. `create_trigger`
had refused ten times; the whole `claude-code-remote` MCP server was
unapproved, `.claude/settings.json` allowlisted it on 2026-09-02, and the first
container that actually restarted with that file in place created the Routine
on the first try.

**Roles now:** the Routine is the mechanism. `CronCreate` is the fallback ONLY
if `list_triggers` shows the Routine gone or repeatedly FAILED. The GitHub
Actions schedule (hourly at :23 + daily 05:12Z, on main) keeps parsing and the
audit running with no session anywhere, and its merge job fast-forwards the dev
branch after committing to main, so pure data commits no longer strand main
ahead.

**Why ~40 firings committed nothing (diagnosed 2026-09-08).** The original
Routine stored `sources: []` and `mcp_connections: []`: every fired session
started with NO repository attached and NO MCP tools — no push credential and
no `add_repo` to obtain one. Each session did 15–20 minutes of work that could
never land, and reported "SUCCEEDED" because delivery, not outcome, is what
last_run records. The 19:17Z diagnostic probe confirmed it by construction:
50k output tokens of work, zero commits on any branch, its report trapped in
its own transcript because reporting required the push it lacked.

**The repair paths, in the order they were closed or taken:** granting fired
sessions the `Claude_Code_Remote` connector (so they could `add_repo` with
push access) is refused — `create_trigger`'s connectors parameter "is not
available for this organization". So the Routine was recreated as a
**SELF-BIND**: it fires hourly INTO the main web session
(`session_01EhZqtGepgDtE1DhzXJu3A9`), which has the repo attached with push
credentials; a wake re-provisions the container with the repo when it was
reclaimed, exactly as `send_later` reminders already demonstrably do. This
also puts the hourly work where the owner looks. If that session is ever
archived and wakes start failing (list_triggers shows non-SUCCEEDED
last_run), the fallback is a fresh web session: attach the repo, run
`create_trigger` self-bind again from it, delete the stale trigger, and
update the ID below.

wampo hourly cycle. Work, report, continue — never delay finished work for a clock. Repo evwes/no-app, dev branch claude/wampo-401k-live-nx1t4o.

BOOTSTRAP (each wake, before anything else): `git fetch origin main claude/wampo-401k-live-nx1t4o` and reconcile — the container may have been reprovisioned since the last wake, and the pipeline commits data hourly. Verify push works EARLY in the first wake after any reprovision: append a line `<UTC timestamp> alive` to docs/routine-heartbeat.log, commit with [skip ci], push. If the push is denied, report the exact error to the owner and stop — that diagnosis is worth more than silent work that cannot land. If a previous cycle in this session left work mid-flight, continue it rather than starting anew.

Read CLAUDE.md first — especially "The gap method (2026-09-03)" and "Current state (2026-09-03)". Do not rediscover what is written there.

FIRST: confirm via `mcp__Claude_Code_Remote__list_triggers` that Routine trig_017vdX5dSSYh5v68Cwe6EUBu ("wampo hourly cycle (self-bind)") is enabled with a recent SUCCEEDED last_run — no more than once per session, not on every wake. Do not create CronCreate jobs unless the Routine is confirmed gone.

SERIALISATION: pushing scripts/build-data.mjs, fetch-4i.mjs, lib-4i.mjs, merge-4i.mjs, scripts/.kick or the workflow while a run is in flight CANCELS it — use [skip ci]. Actions minutes are free (measured). GitHub cron start times are fiction (4-8h late, measured) — dispatch with workflow_dispatch. The daily schedule commits data straight to MAIN, so check `git log origin/main --not origin/<branch>` and bring its commit into the branch (usually a plain fast-forward) BEFORE any mirror; mirror ONLY via `bash scripts/mirror.sh`.

Order of business:
1. RUN IN FLIGHT? (Without MCP tools, infer from git: an "Update filed plan data" commit or a .kick push on either ref in the last 90 minutes means assume one is.) Non-pipeline work only; pipeline commits [skip ci]. When you cannot rule a run out, EVERY commit is [skip ci] and kicks are limited to one per cycle.
2. NO RUN IN FLIGHT? **DISPATCH build-data.yml ON THE DEV BRANCH — EVERY HOUR, whether or not a gated change is waiting.** This step used to fire only when "a gated change is unshipped", and that is why the pipeline was not actually running hourly (owner, 2026-09-15): the GitHub cron `23 * * * *` is the ONLY thing that dispatched on a quiet hour, and GitHub de-prioritises cron on free public runners. Measured 2026-09-15: scheduled runs fired at 10:00, 13:38 and 18:16Z — gaps of 3.5 and 4.5 hours, not one. The Routine at `:07`, by contrast, has fired on the minute every hour. **So the reliable clock was waking a cycle that then declined to dispatch, while the unreliable clock was the only one parsing new filings.** Dispatching costs effectively nothing — Actions minutes are free (measured at zero), a no-op hour exits without committing, and the whole work list on a quiet hour is the ~78 permanently-403 acks. The purpose of the hourly run is to FIND new gaps, holes and incorrect filings as they are filed; a 4-hour gap is 4 hours of filings unexamined. Use `mcp__github__actions_run_trigger` (method `run_workflow`, ref = the dev branch); WITHOUT MCP tools, push a commit whose only change is `date > scripts/.kick` — the documented kick, and the push event is the dispatch. **Verify it started in the run listing before believing it** — the push trigger is intermittent and the dispatch is not. Keep the GitHub cron as the backstop for hours when no session exists; do not remove it.
3. RUN JUST FINISHED? Verdict: pv distribution (one dominant pv, small tail); coverage line in docs/coverage-history.jsonl; `node scripts/diff-lineups.mjs <prev-ref>` (every CONFIDENCE LOST must be a justified fabrication, FABRICATED INTRODUCED must be 0); `node scripts/audit-generic-names.mjs` (baseline 208/threshold 230) and `node scripts/audit-dominant-row.mjs` (holds at 0 — any nonzero is a regression, stop and diagnose; NOTE this audit covers ONE shape and the fabricated class as a whole is NOT closed, see docs/accuracy-log.md 2026-09-15); then mirror via scripts/mirror.sh.
4. OTHERWISE take the next queue item and FINISH it — **and the agent that
   finishes it is `wam`** (`.claude/agents/wam.md`, owner directive
   2026-09-15). Spawn it with the item, its current size in participants, and
   where the evidence is. wam works DEFECTS first and COVERAGE second, ranks
   within each by people affected, and must return an item in one of exactly
   two states: FIXED (shipped, gated, measured, logged) or DOCUMENTED AS
   UNREACHABLE (cause named from evidence, and the PAGE says the true thing).
   "Unknown" is not a state it may leave an item in. Anything needing a
   `PARSER_VERSION` bump plus a full re-parse, or that is NEW COVERAGE rather
   than a repair, comes back as a proposal with its size — it is the owner's
   call, not wam's.

   **Every finding from this cycle goes INTO that queue rather than into prose
   alone.** A defect described in `docs/accuracy-log.md` and nowhere else is
   how three classes sat unworked; the log is the permanent record, not the
   worklist.

   **DO NOT READ A QUEUE OUT OF THIS FILE. The list that used to sit here was
   from 2026-09-03 and every number in it had been superseded** — it said
   `noregion` 1,099 plans (now 6), `band-hi` 270 (now 128), recordkeeper
   missing 4,568 (now 1,419 blank + 1,509 publishing a WRONG NAME), State Farm
   still broken (it publishes 20 Vanguard rows), and — worst — **"the
   fabricated-lineup class is CLOSED at 0", which was corrected on 2026-09-15
   when an owner-sent filing showed it publishing merged holdings.** A stale
   queue in the file that drives every cycle is the "copying a line forward is
   asserting it again" hazard aimed at the work itself. Removed 2026-09-15.

   **The live sources, in order:**
   - `CLAUDE.md` → "Known residuals" table, and read its `reachable` column,
     not the raw size column. Regenerate with `node scripts/gap-census.mjs`
     and reproduce the shipped count before classifying anything.
   - `CLAUDE.md` → "FIELD COVERAGE" (lineups are NOT the largest gap; match
     and vesting are, by people).
   - `docs/accuracy-log.md` → the newest entries are the open defects.
   - `docs/coverage-history.jsonl` → `overshoot` must FALL from 471.

   **Open queue as of 2026-09-15, all owner-gated except where noted:**
   1. Fabricated/unusable published holdings, one `PARSER_VERSION` bump:
      wrapped continuation fragments (Owens Corning `Fund, Class S`),
      loan-rate text as a name (283 plans), the 471 overshoots (PepsiCo
      `Trust` at 50% of its menu), Form 5500 ID fields as holdings (174
      plans — `JUNK_NAME_RE` matches 0 of them), duplicate rows (160),
      and the CODE-COLUMN class (720 plans / 687,851 ppl publishing
      `1VTTHX` where the same PDF prints a legend giving the fund name).
   2. Recordkeeper wrong name: 1,509 plans / 1.48M ppl. Prefer service
      codes 15/64, then the line-1b platform or Schedule A carrier, then
      top-fee; never publish a provider coded 10 or 29.
   3. Discretionary match shown as a standing "Formula" (~4,469 pages) —
      display only, no re-parse.
   4. Schedule A carrier as a recordkeeper source (`build-data.mjs:624`
      resolves it and never reads it).
   5. NEC + eligibility extraction — NEW COVERAGE, owner's call.

   **EVERY CYCLE, alongside the queue item: draw randomly from PUBLISHED
   lineups and read the rows.** Not from the worst bucket — that draw answers
   "what are we missing" and only this one answers "what are we getting
   wrong". Its first run (2026-09-15, 40 plans) found three unnamed classes
   totalling ~1.1M participants; 36 of 40 were clean, so expect a low rate and
   look anyway.

Accuracy protocol: SIZE before fixing, RE-SIZE after (v101 was projected at 65%, delivered 2.5% in-bucket). INSTRUMENT before believing a cause — `WAMPO_TRACE=rows|cands node scripts/trace-filing.mjs <ack>` prints the parser's working. A measuring script is code and earns the same suspicion (size-features.mjs reported 30% where the truth was 7%; gap-verify's table detector fired on Statements of Changes until it required rows that NAME PRODUCTS). Prove a new guard FIRES with a negative control. Read stores through scripts/lib-schema.mjs. Parser changes: parser-gate green + a specimen + a decoy + an entry in docs/defect-specimens.json. Frontend changes: smoke-test.mjs AND map-test.mjs, bump ?v= stamps together. Log every accuracy defect permanently in docs/accuracy-log.md.

Before 7:00 AM Eastern, docs/morning-brief.md current and committed — decision-shaped, HELD-and-why first.
