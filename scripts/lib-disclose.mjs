/* wampo — shared DISCLOSURE decisions: the judgements about what a table
 * means, as opposed to what it contains.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Three times on 2026-09-10 a rule was found living in
 * app.js and missing from scripts/build-seo-pages.mjs: the "withdrawn from the
 * EFAST2 bucket" wording, the match-quote guard, and now the holdings-coverage
 * note. The static pages are not a lesser surface — they are the crawlable
 * ones, the growth engine, and the copy a search engine shows. A caveat the
 * interactive report considers necessary is necessary there too.
 *
 * THE COVERAGE NOTE. A plan's schedule of assets frequently itemises less than
 * the plan holds: the rest sits in a master trust, a pooled account, a general
 * account, or simply is not broken out. Measured 2026-09-10 across the 5,000
 * published static pages, 533 of them showed a fund table the interactive
 * report would have caveated and the static page did not — 12,736,363
 * participants, and the largest employers in the country among them:
 * Walmart at 93%, Amazon 91%, Boeing 78%, and JPMorgan Chase at 66%, whose
 * page listed $34.91B of holdings for a $52.91B plan with nothing to say that
 * $18B was missing from it.
 *
 * Bands, not a bare percentage: the sum is display-precision against a filed
 * total, so a small difference is noise and only a material gap earns a
 * reader's attention. 95-105% is treated as reconciled and says nothing.
 *
 * MASTER-TRUST LINEUPS ARE EXCLUDED, and that is not an oversight: a trust's
 * holdings are a different pool from one member plan's assets, so the ratio is
 * meaningless and a note built on it would be false.

/* THE FILED UNIT OF ACCOUNT — a precision we assert and the filing never gave.
 *
 * Many audited schedules of assets are printed in thousands or millions under
 * their own caption. PPG's 4i page is headed `($ in millions)` and prints
 * `BlackRock Equity Index Fund ... 671`. `parse4i` detects that caption and
 * multiplies up, which is correct and is why the parse reconciles (PPG's menu
 * sums to 93.2% of its Schedule H assets). But the product carries trailing
 * zeros that were never digits in the filing, and the STATIC PAGE printed the
 * product to the dollar: `$671,000,000`.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-27 against the v184 store: 157 published static pages /
 * 5,616,080 participants print holding values to the dollar for a schedule
 * filed in rounded units. Amazon (1,336,478 participants) shows
 * `$4,619,443,000`; PPG shows `$671,000,000` for a figure filed as `671`, and
 * a `$2,000,000` row on that page means only "between $1.5M and $2.5M".
 * No digit is fabricated — the zeros are the filing's own declared scaling —
 * but the page implies a figure known to the dollar, and two rows a million
 * apart on a millions-filed schedule are not distinguishable at all.
 *
 * THE INTERACTIVE REPORT DOES NOT HAVE THIS DEFECT, which is why the note is
 * added here and not mirrored into app.js: `money()` renders at most three or
 * four significant figures (`$671.0M`, `$4.6B`), so it asserts nothing the
 * filing did not state. The usual direction of travel in this file is a
 * qualifier the report applies and the static page omits; this is the reverse —
 * a claim the static page makes and the report does not — so the fix belongs
 * where the claim is, and one copy of the rule is better than two.
 *
 * THE FILING'S OWN DECLARATION IS WHAT LICENCES THE SENTENCE, NOT AN INFERENCE
 * FROM ROUND NUMBERS. `parse4i` records `thousands: best.scale > 1` on every
 * entry it scales — a filed fact that has been written to every lineup shard
 * and READ BY NOTHING: not merge-4i, not audit-data, not app.js, not this
 * generator. That is the computed-and-discarded shape this project keeps
 * paying for, so the flag is the gate here. Inferring "filed in thousands"
 * from "every value is a multiple of 1,000" would be an inference, and it is
 * wrong at least once: Fifth Third Bancorp's 31-row menu has no value that is
 * a multiple of 1,000 yet one confident plan in the store is all-round without
 * any units caption.
 *
 * The flag is a BOOLEAN and does not say WHICH unit (scale is 1,000 or
 * 1,000,000 — see `variants` in lib-4i). The granularity is therefore read off
 * the values, which is safe because it is a statement about OUR OWN published
 * figures rather than about the filing, and because it was checked over the
 * entire flagged population: 219 entries carry the flag, all 219 are wholly
 * $1,000 multiples, 10 are wholly $1,000,000 multiples, and ZERO are neither —
 * so this never returns null for a flagged entry and never has to guess. All
 * ten millions members were read one by one (Dow, Regions, PPG, Comerica,
 * Trinity, Louisiana-Pacific and one trust among the confident ones) and every
 * one files two-to-four-digit figures under a millions caption. */

/* THE FROZEN CLAIM. `frozen` means "the filing states contributions have been
 * discontinued", and the report renders it as a warning banner. 1,378 plans
 * carry it and some of those warnings are false.
 *
 * A CORRECTION TO MY OWN FIRST ATTEMPT, ON THE RECORD. The first version of
 * this guard suppressed the warning whenever the plan reported employer
 * contributions, reasoning that a filing cannot both pay and say it has
 * stopped. **That reasoning was wrong.** A plan terminated in June contributes
 * January to June and files a final-year return showing both — paying and
 * terminating are not contradictory, they are the ordinary shape of a
 * final-year filing. Measured: that guard hid 830 plans of which **750 were
 * genuine terminations** (637,268 participants) to catch 80 false ones. It
 * traded one wrong statement for nine suppressed true ones.
 *
 * WHAT ACTUALLY SEPARATES THEM IS THE TEXT, and specifically WHICH PLAN IS THE
 * SUBJECT of the verb. Two shapes are false:
 *   - CONDITIONAL. "in the event the Company terminates or permanently
 *     discontinues contributions" is the boilerplate ERISA vesting clause in
 *     nearly every plan document, describing nothing that happened.
 *   - A DIFFERENT PLAN IS THE SUBJECT. Comcast's notes say "The Solar Energy
 *     World 401k plan was frozen"; Leggett & Platt's say "the Hanes Retirement
 *     Plan was frozen" — while Hanes Companies' OWN filing says "the Plan was
 *     frozen" and is kept, which is the distinction working.
 *
 * Tying the name to the VERB rather than to the sentence matters: "the Plan
 * was frozen, and employees became eligible to participate in the Cayuga
 * Health 401(k)" mentions another plan as the DESTINATION while this plan is
 * what froze. Judging the sentence got 3 of 6 sampled wrong; judging the
 * subject got 22 of 22 right.
 *
 * Measured: rejects 60 (482,259 participants), keeps 1,318. Sampled 12
 * rejections and 10 keeps at random — all 22 correct. */

 *
 * `build-seo-pages.mjs:185` rendered `titleCase(f.name)` — the RAW stored name
 * — so NOT ONE arm of this function had ever reached a crawlable page. Measured
 * on the v188 store across the 4,952 published pages that carry a lineup:
 * **2,790 of 162,717 rows print a name the report reader never sees, on pages
 * serving 9,689,129 participants.** Every repair this project has shipped at
 * display time was invisible there — the leading CUSIP ("922908371 VANGUARD EXT
 * MKT INDX-INST+"), the `(1)` footnote (1.95M ppl), the OCR bar read as a
 * share-class I (683k), the kerned de-spacer, the UnitedHealth address strip
 * (274,906), the doubled house prefix (486k), TYPE_PREFIX and TYPE_SUFFIX.
 *
 * This is the SECOND TIME in one day that two display paths diverged: the
 * false-precision defect was recorded as affecting the report and was only ever
 * on these same static pages. The rule earned twice: **there are TWO display
 * paths and a claim about readers must name which.**
 *
 * app.js keeps its own copy because it is a plain browser script with no module
 * system — the established shape for `frozenClaimOk` and `coverageBand` — and
 * the copies are TETHERED: `smoke-test.mjs` runs the BROWSER copy against this
 * module on filed names taken from the real store and fails on any drift. Three
 * untethered copies of one rule is how the match-quote guard published a false
 * heading on 615 pages.

   * remainder resolves through fund-er.js) reached 19 rows because that table
   * cannot name a Principal separate account or a CIT BY DESIGN.

   * TOKENS. Below that sit `Shares`, `Fee Class R1`, `and`, `Omitted`, `III`,

   * that carries naming content. Each exclusion below was earned by reading a
   * suspect, and one of them is the v188 pinned DECOY: `Separate Account A,
   * at fair value` survives only because the comma is stripped before `A` is
   * judged a bare code. GICs leave the vocabulary entirely, because a GIC's
   * filed name really is the type plus a CONTRACT NUMBER (`GA 29013 DTD
   * 04/28/11`). The participles are what saved the OTHER pinned control:
   * `Index Fund invested in stocks included in the S&P 500` was being cut to
   * `invested in stocks…` until `invested` joined the furniture — a control
   * written last cycle caught this cycle's draft, which is what controls are
