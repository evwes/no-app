/* Regenerate app.js's twin of `isGenericTypeName` FROM lib-4i, never by hand.
 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES IN THE REPO, which is the lesson that put it here: it lived
 * in a session scratchpad, a container restart wiped it, and the next change
 * to lib-4i's derivation arrived with no way to regenerate the copy that must
 * track it. A generator the published page depends on is not a scratch file.
 * Twice now that directory has been cleared mid-session.
 *
 * lib-4i builds GENERIC_TYPE_ANY and GENERIC_TYPE_DESPACED from
 * GENERIC_TYPE_NAME by asserted string replacements — they are DERIVED
 * patterns, and transcribing a derived pattern is the move this record says
 * produces wrong answers. So take the COMPILED sources at runtime and write
 * them into app.js as literals. `smoke-test.mjs` then ties the two together,
 * so a change to the derivation shows up as drift rather than as silence.
 *
 * Run it after ANY change to GENERIC_TYPE_NAME, GENERIC_DECO,
 * stripGenericDecoration or isGenericTypeName:
 *     node scripts/gen-generic-twin.mjs
